# OpenCV Project - AI Virtual Mouse
---
### This Python script allows you to control your computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures captured through your webcam. It uses the OpenCV library for image processing, HandTrackingModule for hand detection, and autopy for controlling the mouse.

---
# Usage
---
### 1. A window will open showing the live webcam feed with some tracking information.
### 2. When you move your index finger with other fingers closed, the cursor will follow your finger's movement.
### 3. If you open both your index and middle fingers and bring them closer, it will simulate a mouse click.
